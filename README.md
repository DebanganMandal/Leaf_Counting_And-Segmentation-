# Leaf Counting And Segmentation
This repository contains the required coding and the architecture for the CVPPP-LCC-challenge. High-throughput image-based plant phenotyping facilitates the computation of phenotypes by analyzing a large number of plants in short time interval with precision, nullifying the need for time-consuming physical human labor.
Please try to use better hardware and check if the IDE is GPU enabled. It would help a lot in computing and processing the code.
